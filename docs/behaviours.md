# Script execution

I have a knowledgebase installed, such as UK Taxation.

UK Taxation depends on various pieces of information such as my gross salary and my net pay.

The UK Taxation knowledge base is script based and accepts JSON on stdin and emits JSON on stdout.

The script is always assumed to be named after the knowledgebase name?

./uk-tax < echo {}
